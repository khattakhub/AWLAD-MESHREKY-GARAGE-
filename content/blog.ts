Here are five essential tips to keep your car in top shape.</p><h3>1. Regular Oil Changes</h3><p>Engine oil is the lifeblood of your car. It lubricates moving parts, reduces friction, and helps keep the engine cool. Follow your manufacturer's recommended oil change schedule, typically every 5,000 to 10,000 km.</p><h3>2. Check Your Tires</h3><p>Proper tire pressure is vital for safety, fuel efficiency, and tire longevity. Check the pressure monthly and before long trips. Don't forget to check the tread depth and rotate your tires as recommended.</p><h3>3. Brake System Inspection</h3><p>Your brakes are your most important safety feature. Have them inspected regularly. Listen for any unusual noises like squeaking or grinding, which could indicate worn brake pads.</p><h3>4. Maintain Fluid Levels</h3><p>Besides engine oil, your car relies on several other fluids, including coolant, transmission fluid, brake fluid, and power steering fluid. Regularly check these levels and top them up as needed, or bring your car to us for a professional check.</p><h3>5. Replace Air Filters</h3><p>Your engine's air filter and cabin air filter play important roles in performance and comfort. A clogged engine air filter can reduce fuel efficiency, while a dirty cabin air filter affects the quality of the air you breathe inside the car. Check and replace them according to your owner's manual.</p>`

        content: `<h2>Knowing Your Limits</h2><p>While DIY car maintenance can be rewarding and save money, it's crucial to know which jobs are safe to tackle at home and which should be left to the professionals. Simple tasks like changing wiper blades or topping up fluids are great for DIYers. However, complex jobs involving the engine, transmission, or safety systems like brakes and airbags should always be handled by certified technicians with the right tools and expertise.</p>`
